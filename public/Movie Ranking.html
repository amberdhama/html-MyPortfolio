    <H3>READY PLAYER ONE</H3>
    <P>
        I don't know how to express myself at the moment, I just finished watching the movie ... and I need a T-shirt I'm sweating
        Ready Player One is my favorite movie I've ever seen, and there are a lot of movies I like but that touched me the most, I connected with it because I'm a gamer ... I know what it means.
        Sometimes yes, I also spent a few more hours playing video games, because yes I disconnect from the real world which sometimes I don't even want to know what's going on, you can be who you want or play a story, or for fun .but we must not forget to stop, the real world is ... real.
        This movie is not just a movie it's a message, for all gamers!

    <H3>TENET</H3>
    <P>
        So guys the wait is over as we come across another much awaited Sci-fi thriller from Mr. Nolan, the Tenet which is a inversion itself of the number TEN read same from both sides.
        I can understand why even critics are not on board with this one as it never gives enough time nor possible explanation to the audiences to fully immerse in the experience and Appreciate the beauty of it all. I have watched it twice as of now and can say with confidence that this is his best work since Inception. Not only he plays with time here as we saw in The Interstellar (2014) but creates a new ground of reality altogether. A lot of exposition thrown at you with a whole lot of Jargons to follow which are explained so fast that you can't even blink your eye and I am serious ( so much for Tight editing üòÅ).

    <H3>YOUR NAME</H3>

        "Your Name" is an enchanting anime film that captivates audiences with its compelling story, stunning visuals, and heartfelt emotions. Directed by Makoto Shinkai, this critically acclaimed movie takes viewers on an extraordinary journey of love, fate, and connection.One of the standout elements of "Your Name" is its beautifully crafted narrative. The story revolves around two protagonists, Taki and Mitsuha, who inexplicably begin to switch bodies intermittently. As they navigate each other's lives and strive to unravel the mystery behind their connection, the film artfully combines elements of romance, drama, and fantasy. The plot gradually unfolds, keeping viewers engaged and invested in the characters' intertwined destinies.
